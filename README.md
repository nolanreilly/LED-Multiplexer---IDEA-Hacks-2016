# LED-multiplexer-IDEA-hacks-2016
7x7 multiplexed LED grid controller, implementing hand and mouth gestures from the XBOX Kinect.
Each function written lights up a specific pattern on the LED array to correlate to the gesture input to the XBOX Kinect. 
mouthClosed, mouthOpen, handClosed, and handOpen are fairly straightforward. Lasso implies a double "peace" sign.
